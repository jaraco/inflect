v6.0.2
======

* #169: Require pydantic 1.9.1 to avoid ``ValueError``.

v6.0.1
======

* Minor tweaks and packaging refresh.

v6.0.0
======

* #157: ``compare`` methods now validate their inputs
  and will raise a more meaningful exception if an
  empty string or None is passed. This expectation is now
  documented.

* Many public methods now perform validation on arguments.
  An empty string is no longer allowed for words or text.
  Callers are expected to pass non-empty text or trap
  the validation errors that are raised. The exceptions
  raised are ``pydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError``,
  which are currently a subclass of ``ValueError``, but since
  that
  `may change <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validation_decorator/#validation-exception>`_,
  tests check for a generic ``Exception``.

v2.0.1
======

* #57: Fix pluralization of taco.

v2.0.0
======

* #37: fix inconsistencies with the inflect method

  We now build and parse AST to extract function arguments instead of relying
  on regular expressions. This also adds support for keyword arguments and
  built-in constants when calling functions in the string.
  Unfortunately, this is not backwards compatible in some cases:
* Strings should now be wrapped in single or double quotes
  p.inflect("singular_noun(to them)") should now be p.inflect("singular_noun('to them')")
* Empty second argument to a function will now be parsed as None instead of ''.
  p.inflect("num(%d,) eggs" % 2) now prints "2 eggs" instead of " eggs"
  Since None, True and False are now supported, they can be passed explicitly:
  p.inflect("num(%d, False) eggs" % 2) will print " eggs"
  p.inflect("num(%d, True) eggs" % 2) will print "2 eggs"
